# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the School District Analysis
For this Analysis we were asked to analysis a school district. They wanted us to look at the districts key metrics to see how they can improve themselve. They want us to find the top and botton five schools, average math and reading scores by grade and school, and the performance on the budget, school size, and tyoe of school. When we got done with that they noticed that the file had edvidnces of academic dishonesty. Which made them ask us to redo the data with out the bad data to see if it effect the results.
## Results
- How is the district summary affected?
  - When we took out the ninth grade data that was effect. We noticed that the numbers only drop by less than %1.

- How is the school summary affected and the school?
 - It affect the school summary about the same. It did not move the school out of the top five when the ninth graders where not include. However when you include them it lowers the school out of the top five.
- Math and reading scores by grade
 -it did not have a big difference because we took them out instead of giving them a zero.
- Scores by school spending
 -The data did not change the spending on math or reading but it did have an impact on the spending range.
- Scores by school size
 -This is where there was an impact because you are taking a whole grade out so it affect the medium-size schools
- Scores by school type
 -It did not have an affect here because of how far ahead the charter schools where ahead of the district school.
## Summary
In the end the data was not effect as much as we though it was going to have. It only affect math and reading scores my less than a %1. The area it did have change was on the spending range by perccentage when you include the ninth grades but not their score. It decrease math by %6 and reading by %7.
